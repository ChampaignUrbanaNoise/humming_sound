There is a constant humming sound in Chanpaign and Urbana from students, doctors and families.

The Chanpaign Police department is responsible for enforcing industrial noise complaints.  Upon calling the Champaign POlice department to ask if anyone else had reported such a sound, to address the magnitude of the problem, they politely and helpfully said that there was not.

It seemed unlikely that during the coronavirus pandemic no one had reported what
is quite obviously a very annoying and disturbing humming which is nearly always present in its highest decibal form and is present 24/7 to a lesser yet noticeable extent. Internet research search queries of "humming sound in Champaign" produce some very odd results. It took days of reading through all of the hundreds of pages to find the few that actually represent the case of the noise pollution found here -- despite the COVID-19 pandemic having queited the city with a relative absence of aircraft and construction.

There are in fact a number of comp0aints made by citizens of Chanpaign County and residents of Champaign and Urbana themselves which were brought before City Councils and the Champaign city council. The complaints though sparse in number are poignant in stories of people who were forced from their homes by Wind Turbine noise.
