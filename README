There is a constant humming sound in Chanpaign and Urbana from students, doctors
 and families.

The Chanpaign Police department is responsible for enforcing industrial noise co
mplaints.  Upon calling the Champaign POlice department to ask if anyone else ha
d reported such a sound, to address the magnitude of the problem, they politely 
and helpfully said that there was not.

It seemed unlikely that during the coronavirus pandemic no one had reported what
is quite obviously a very annoying and disturbing humming which is nearly always
 present in its highest decibal form and is present 24/7 to a lesser yet noticea
ble extent. Internet research search queries of "humming sound in Champaign" pro
duce some very odd results. It took days of reading through all of the hundreds 
of pages to find the few that actually represent the case of the noise pollution
 found here -- despite the COVID-19 pandemic having queited the city with a rela
tive absence of aircraft and construction.

There are in fact a number of comp0aints made by citizens of Chanpaign County an
d residents of Champaign and Urbana themselves which were brought before City Co
uncils and the Champaign city council. The complaints though sparse in number ar
e poignant in stories of people who were forced from their homes by Wind Turbine
 noise.

The reason that the wind turbine compliants are few in number is a bit shocking 
in reality. The search queries overlap with what is referred to as a disturbing 
phenomenon people called the "global hum". It takes many refinements of search q
queries to get past the pages this quite incorrect explanation. Because only 2% 
of people can hear the sound and the low quality informaton surrounding its expl
anation -- citizens of our city are left with an explanation that is causing med
ical doctors, their families and themselves to question the sanity and fitness o
f their minds. University of Illinois research supplying results with the specif
ic query "Champaign" bring the number of pages that a citizen must search throug
h much higher than typical. Indeed, the citizens of smaller outlysing cities whi
ch also have problems with wind farm noise return query results many times more 
useful than the citizens of Champaign.

University students report on reddit using light language to indicate that they 
thought they were losing their minds. MOst won't admit to such. As well they sho
uld not, because wind farm turbines, power plant noise, Kraft and Solo Cup noise
 make it difficult to pinpoint the source -- and the stigmatizing and ridiculous
 global hum explanation make it impossible to explain what it happening even if 
they were to admit.

Citizens and students are not calling the police department because they fear  t
hey have lost thier minds. The constant droning sound, even for rural peoples wi
th only a single and well known source is reported to have caused great psycholo
gical disturbance as well havig been proven to do so. It is not a stretch of the
 imagainstion to hypothesis that the citizens of Champaign whom already suffer f
rom mental illnesses have absolutey no idea why their homes appear to be shaking
 and rumbling and the explanations that they must come up with are heartbreaking
 to consider. It's doubtful that Carle Hosppital's staff would discern that the 
compaints of these citizens' complaints explainable.

Proposition:
Mailings should be provided to citizens in a cost effective manner that explain 
what these disturbing sounds are such that they are subject to the nearly imposs
ible to navigate search queries.

The police departments should be informed that those calling in with complaints 
of "humming" that ehtically should be provided an explanationn, that:
	1. The humming sound sources, as there are mmny
	2. That these sounds likely are permitted.

OUr citizens are not weak or foolish. However, the lack of reports indicates tha
t the unfornate nature of the internet search query results they are obtaining h
ave caused them to make the decision to not report it at all while we all shelte
r in our homes. What has happened is sad, but it is no one's fault. Even univers
ity students, some PhD candidates, can not wade through all of this information 
to produce a thorough ecplanation and refer primarily to only 1 of the sources =
= Abbot power plant. It took days of dedicated research to reveal the simple fac
t that Champaign and Urbana's humming and droning noises are 1. real (not global
 humming) 2. They have no 1 specifc source and 3. the bravery to call the police
 department and humbly ask. Then the task had to be repeated and this web page h
ad to be created in order to finally even barely approach what is required to ma
nage this problem.

THose that make it to the end of this sad journey and have went before city coun
cil hit the pitfall of suggesting that installations of wind farms or factories 
should be removed or queited -- They clearly don't know how things work around h
ere. Some of us like factories and others like wind energy and still others pref
er solar. Motorcycles and what can only be called monster truck will alwaays be 
welcome to race at full speed limit maxima on our streets.

So they failed too. Some of theri email addresses long abandoned.


Let's at least inform our citizens of what is going on.

Without profiteering and at 50 cents a stamp, 10 cents an envelope and 10 cents 
a print out a notice could be distributed.

One call to the police station by an official with rank telling them to inform q
uestining citizens where the noise comes from would help in the meantime that an
yone may call in to ask about this sad problem. 

In the meantime, I'll contact city council, the police department and attempts t
o set up a search query counter for google such that the problem of search obfus
cation of the terms "Champaign humming noise" can be tracked and we can get back
 to battling the pandemic and comfort our ill family members who, for years, mus
t have been suffering.
